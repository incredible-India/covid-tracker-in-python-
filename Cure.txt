Self-care
If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat nutritious food.
 Stay in a separate room from other family members, and use a dedicated bathroom
 if possible. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.
Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a healthy diet,
 sleep, stay active, and make social contact with loved ones through the
 phone or internet. Children need extra love and attention from adults during difficult times.
 Keep to regular routines and schedules as much as possible.
It is normal to feel sad, stressed, or confused during a crisis. 
Talking to people you trust, such as friends and family, can help. If you feel
 overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or counsellor.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is in a family of viruses called Coronaviridae.
 Antibiotics do not work against viruses.

Some people who become ill with COVID-19 can also develop a bacterial infection as a complication. 
In this case, antibiotics may be recommended by a health care provider.

There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19. If you have symptoms, call your health
 care provider or COVID-19 hotline for assistance.
